# Theory and Analysis of Linear Timeinvariant Systems

This is the english version of a manuscript I wrote over the summer of 2021 because I was bored. 
The original is in german and can be found [here](https://github.com/milanofthe/Lineare-Zeitinvariante-Systeme-Skript). 
The translation into english has been done with claude code over the course of just a few days. Turned out pretty good I'd say.


## How this came to be

In early 2021, right after finishing my BA in EE, a friend was learning about the laplace transform in the 
context of his vehicle dynamics class. I just wanted to write him a quick 10 page overview on the laplace transform. 

Turns out I didnt stop there and spent the next three months writing a couple of pages per day. Time domain analysis, 
stability, frequency domain, bode plots. Well... definitely an interesting experience.
